# Password-generator

## Description

Creating a password generator allowed me use a combination of methods and functions which helped me gain an understanding of how they all work together and the logics of coding.

Touched base with TA on more advanced topics such as regex. I wanted to make sure my password generator is foolproof, meaning if the user wants the password to include lowercase, uppercase...etc, it won't be missing from the password generator. Regex with conditionals seems to be a good choice for this purpose.
